        <p id="nature"><strong>Singapore</strong>'s natural vegetation is tropical rainforests, but most of them have been cleared and given over to agriculture, water tanks and urban development. The northern and northwestern regions remain the last untouched islands of equatorial vegetation, but most of them are cultivated and used as a garden and park area. Foci of forests have also been preserved on the islands.</p>

Being a city-state of businessmen surrounded by countries with cheap labor, Singapore, on the one hand, develops the entire European cultural complex and represents the culture of various ethnic groups, and on the other hand, it has developed a number of specific features.</p>
